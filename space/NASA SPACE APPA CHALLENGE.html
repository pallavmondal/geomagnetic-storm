         <right><P><h3><b>The May 2024 geomagnetic storms, triggered ​by solar flares and coronal mass ejections, ​caused disruptions on Earth. The storms, ​reaching severe levels (KP 7-8), affected:

            Technology: Satellite orbits were altered, ​communications and GPS were disrupted, ​and power grids experienced issues.
            
            Environment: Auroras were visible at lower ​latitudes, and radiation levels increased for ​astronauts and flights.
            
            Human Impact: Airlines rerouted polar ​flights to reduce radiation exposure.
            
            These events highlighted the need for better ​space weather monitoring and stronger ​infrastructure to handle future storms</b></h3></P> </right>

    <h3><b>
        Geomagnetic storms, caused by ​disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field due ​to solar activity, can have significant ​impacts on everyday life. These storms ​can disrupt satellite communications, ​GPS navigation, power grids, and even ​aviation. Raising public awareness about ​these risks is crucial to help people ​understand how dependent modern ​technology is on space weather. ​Promoting the importance of space ​weather forecasting can ensure better ​preparedness, helping mitigate the effects ​of such storms and safeguard essential ​services.
